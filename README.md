# ToDo list w/ React.js (no database backing)

This is a simple to-do list written with React.js. The items on the
list are not backed by a database so they will not persist between page
reloads.

## Implementation Steps

1. Create html page and import required assets.
2. Create input component
3. Create list component
4. Create functionality to delete a list item
5. Create functionality to edit a list item
6. Create functionality to check a list item

## Configuration steps

1. You need to run a local server in order to have this work correclty.
   I used `http-server`, which is available on npm. You can easily boot
up a local server by running `npm install http-server -g` and in the
directory of the project, run `http-server`. The ToDo list will be
available at `http://127.0.0.1:8080/to-do.html`. If you don't want to
use `npm` you can check

out to configure your local server.
